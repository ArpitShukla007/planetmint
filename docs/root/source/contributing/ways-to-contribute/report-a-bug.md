# Write a Planetmint Enhancement Proposal (PEP)

If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, and you want some feedback before you write a full Planetmint Enhancement Proposal (PEP), then feel free to:
  - ask in the [planetmint/community Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/planetmint/planetmint) or
  - [open a new issue in the planetmint/PEPs repo](https://github.com/planetmint/PEPs/issues/new) and give it the label **PEP idea**.

If you want to discuss an existing PEP, then [open a new issue in the planetmint/PEPs repo](https://github.com/planetmint/BEPs/issues/new) and give it the label **discuss existing PEP**.

## Steps to Write a New PEP

1. Look at the structure of existing PEPs in the [planetmint/PEPs repo](https://github.com/planetmint/PEPs). Note the section headings. [PEP-2](https://github.com/planetmint/PEPs/tree/master/2) (our variant of the consensus-oriented specification system [COSS]) says more about the expected structure and process.
1. Write a first draft of your PEP. It doesn't have to be long or perfect.
1. Push your BEP draft to the [planetmint/PEPs repo](https://github.com/planetmint/PEPs) and make a pull request. [PEP-1](https://github.com/planetmint/PEPs/tree/master/1) (our variant of C4) outlines the process we use to handle all pull requests. In particular, we try to merge all pull requests quickly.
1. Your PEP can be revised by pushing more pull requests.
