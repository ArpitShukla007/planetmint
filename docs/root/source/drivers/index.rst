Drivers
=======

Connectors to Planetmint are referred to as drivers within the community. A driver is used to create valid transactions, to generate key pairs, to sign transactions and to post the transaction to the Planetmint API. 

These drivers were originally created by the original Planetmint team:

* `Python Driver <https://docs.planetmint.io/projects/py-driver/en/latest/index.html>`_
* `JavaScript / Node.js Driver <https://github.com/planetmint/js-planetmint-driver>`_
* `Java Driver <https://github.com/planetmint/java-planetmint-driver>`_

These drivers and tools were created by the Planetmint community:

.. warning::

   Some of these projects are a work in progress,
   but may still be useful.
   Others might not work with the latest version of Planetmint.

* `ANSI C driver <https://github.com/RiddleAndCode/planetmint-c-driver>`_, should also work with C++ (working as of June 2019)
* `C# driver <https://github.com/Omnibasis/planetmint-csharp-driver>`_ (working as of May 2019)
* `Haskell transaction builder <https://github.com/planetmint/planetmint-hs>`_
* `Go driver <https://github.com/zbo14/envoke/blob/master/planetmint/planetmint.go>`_
* `Ruby driver <https://github.com/LicenseRocks/planetmint_ruby>`_
